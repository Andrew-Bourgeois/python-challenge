UNC-CH-DA Module 3-Python Challenge

Instructions for Running Scripts:
*   Clone the repository to your local
*   Change directory to either PyBank or PyPoll based on which 'main.py' script you are running.

Background: Create Python scripts to analyze csv data, report analyses to terminal and export analysis results to new text files.

Assignment:
*   create a GitHub repository called "python-challenge"
*   clone repository locally and add a README and (2) folders: 'PrBank' and 'PyPoll'
* In each folder add a 'main.py' file, a 'Resources' folder to hold the raw csv data for each exercise, and an 'analysis' folder where you will export a new txt file with the results.

PyBank Instructions: analyze csv financial dataset and calculate/report:
*   total number of months in dataset
*   net Total of "Profit/Losses" from entire period
*   changes in "Profit/Losses" mos-to-mos and the average change
*   greatest increase and decrease in profit (date & time)
*   report results to terminal
*   export results to a new txt doc in 'analysis' folder

PyPoll Instructions: review a csv of poll data and analyzes votes and calculates:
*   total number of votes
*   complete list of candidates who received votes
*   percentage of votes each candidate received
*   total number of votes each candidate received
*   winner of election based on most votes
*   report results to terminal
*   export results to a new txt file in 'analysis' folder
